# Postman Tech Writer Challenge

_A 15-day hands-on API learning journey for aspiring tech writers—no coding required._

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

There’s a growing demand for tech writers who can document APIs, but most resources assume you already know how to code or work with developer tools. That’s a problem.

This repo is my response to that gap.

It’s a clean, private reworking of the official “15 Days of Postman” challenge—designed specifically for tech writers who want to build API fluency without needing a public Postman profile or prior experience. It’s also a portfolio piece I’m building to demonstrate how tech writers can learn, teach, and document APIs in a way that’s approachable, structured, and genuinely useful.

## 👩‍💻 Who This Is For

- Tech writers looking to transition into API documentation
- Writers who feel blocked by lack of coding experience
- Anyone curious about APIs and Postman but unsure where to start
- Hiring managers who want to see how I approach technical education

---

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

- How to use Postman to explore and test APIs
- How to write and validate API tests without writing code
- How to structure API documentation workflows
- How to build a portfolio-ready API project from scratch

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo

Each folder (`01-api-client` through `15-final-project`) contains:

- A Postman collection you can import and run privately
- A README with step-by-step instructions and explanations
- Screenshots and notes to guide you through each concept

Start with `01-api-client` and work your way through. You don’t need a public Postman profile, and you don’t need to write code. Just follow along, experiment, and learn.

## ✍️ Tutorial Series

Check out the `tutorial-series/` folder for deeper articles on:

- API basics for tech writers
- How Postman works (without the jargon)
- Writing tests without being a developer
- Documenting APIs you didn’t build
- Building confidence in technical spaces

These are written with empathy for writers who are new to APIs and want to grow without feeling overwhelmed.

## 🙋 About Me

## 🙋 About Me

I’m an aspiring API tech writer currently making the transition from web development. Having spent years navigating the often overwhelming world of code, I understand firsthand how intimidating it can feel to break into API documentation—especially if you don’t come from a traditional programming background.

This project is my way of turning that experience into something useful. It’s built with empathy for writers who want to master API tools like Postman but feel unsure where to start. My goal is to make the learning curve less daunting, more structured, and genuinely empowering for those who are new to technical spaces.

If you’re hiring for API documentation roles, this repo reflects how I approach learning, teaching, and writing about developer tools—with clarity, patience, and a deep respect for the non-coding path.
