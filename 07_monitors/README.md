# Day 7: Monitors

_Keep your APIs healthy‚Äîwith automated monitoring in Postman._

---

## üß≠ Overview

Today you'll learn how to use **Monitors** in Postman to automatically run requests on a schedule and track performance, uptime, and correctness. Monitors are like automated testers that keep an eye on your APIs‚Äîeven when you're not around.

For tech writers, monitors help validate that documented endpoints behave as expected. They also provide data to support reliability claims in your documentation.

### 4. Debug Failures

- If a request fails, click into the run result
- Use the **Console** and **Test Results** tabs to investigate
- Common issues include:
  - Incorrect environment variables
  - Expired tokens
  - Network errors

## üß† What Just Happened?

You created a monitor to automatically run your API requests, scheduled it to run regularly, and reviewed the results. This is how Postman helps you ensure your APIs stay reliable and your documentation stays accurate.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Tech Writer‚Äôs Lens

Monitors are a powerful tool for validating your documentation. You can set up monitors to test example requests, check for expected responses, and alert you when something breaks‚Äîso your docs are always trustworthy.

---

## üìö Glossary

- **Monitor**: A scheduled run of API requests that checks performance and correctness
- **Run Result**: The outcome of a monitor execution, including status codes and test logs
- **Schedule**: The frequency at which a monitor runs (hourly, daily, etc.)
