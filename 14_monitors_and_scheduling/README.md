# Day 14: Monitors and Scheduling

_Keep your API healthy‚Äîwith automated, scheduled monitoring._

---

## üß≠ Overview

Today you'll learn how to schedule **Monitors** in Postman to run automatically at regular intervals. Monitors help you track uptime, performance, and correctness‚Äîwithout manual effort.

For tech writers, scheduled monitors validate that your documentation examples and sample requests continue to work over time. They‚Äôre your early warning system for broken endpoints.

- How to schedule monitor runs (hourly, daily, weekly)
- How to use environments with monitors
- How to view and interpret monitor results
- How to use monitors to validate documentation

### 4. Debug Failures

- If a request fails, click into the run result
- Use the **Console** and **Test Results** tabs to investigate
- Common issues include:
  - Incorrect environment variables
  - Expired tokens
  - Network errors

---

### 5. Use Monitors to Validate Docs

- Monitors can run your documented requests regularly
- If a sample request fails, you‚Äôll know before your readers do
- This helps keep your documentation trustworthy and up to date

---

## üß† What Just Happened?

You created a monitor, scheduled it to run automatically, and reviewed the results. This is how Postman helps you automate API health checks and ensure your documentation stays accurate.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Tech Writer‚Äôs Lens

Scheduled monitors are your safety net. They validate your examples, catch broken endpoints, and help you maintain reliable documentation‚Äîwithout manual testing.

---

## üìö Glossary

- **Monitor**: A scheduled run of API requests that checks performance and correctness
- **Schedule**: The frequency at which a monitor runs (hourly, daily, etc.)
- **Run Result**: The outcome of a monitor execution, including status codes and test logs
