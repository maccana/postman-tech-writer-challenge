# Day 3: Collections

_Group your API requests like a pro—with Postman Collections._

---

## 🧭 Overview

Today you'll learn how to use **Collections** in Postman to organize your API requests. Collections are like folders for your API work—they help you group related requests, add documentation, and share your work with others.

For tech writers, collections are the backbone of structured API documentation. They allow you to document endpoints, add examples, and prepare your work for publishing.

---

### 5. Preview Your Collection

- Click on the collection name
- Select the **View complete documentation** button
- You’ll see a clean, structured view of your collection and its requests

This is what developers and stakeholders will see when you share your work.

## 🧠 What Just Happened?

You created a collection, added a folder, saved a request, and documented it—all inside Postman. This is how tech writers structure API documentation: by grouping endpoints, adding context, and preparing collections for sharing or publishing.

---

## ✍️ Tech Writer’s Lens

Collections are more than just folders—they’re **living documentation**. You can add descriptions, examples, scripts, and even publish them as public docs. This is how Postman bridges the gap between testing and documentation.

---

## 📚 Glossary

- **Collection**: A group of related API requests
- **Folder**: A sub-group inside a collection
- **Request**: An action sent to an API (e.g., GET, POST)
- **Documentation Tab**: Where you describe what a request does
